**typer** introduces a new type coercion operator, and fixes some unexpected behaviour in base R. 

## Installation

You can install the stable version of typer from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with 
``` {r, eval = FALSE} 
install.packages("typer")
```
The latest, development version is also available from [github](https://github.com/JSzitas/typer) using the *devtools* package

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JSzitas/typer")
```

## Introduction

**typer** introduces a new typing operator, **%t%**, and further simplifies type coercion in R, by fixing some of the unintuitive things that occur in **R**. Thus it seeks to provide a more intuitive (and bracket free!) way to coerce types. 

## Examples 
Consider the classic problem with as.numeric. 
````{r, eval = FALSE}
as.numeric(c(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10"))
# will return NA where 0,6 and 0,5
# though it seems rather unambiguous that those vector elements should be coerced to type numeric
# as_numeric to the rescue

as_numeric(c(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10"))

# it will also give warnings where this is not possible

as_numeric(c(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10","chicken"))

# and it also works as a shorthand for the apply/lapply commands when used with matrices / data.frames / data.tables / lists
as_numeric(list(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10","chicken"))

as_numeric(data.frame(matrix(data = c(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10"), nrow = 2)))

````
There are similar methods for coercing to type character and type factor. 

There is also a new operator! 
````{r, eval = FALSE}
# the package namesake, typer
A <- c(0.7,"0,6","0,5","10")
A %t% "num"
A %t% "numeric"
# typer accepts both a character string, as well as its shorthand

# works by default with the functions for coercion defined within itself (where possible)
A %t% "char"

# and works with user defined variables as shorthands, ie: 
nm <- "numeric"

A %t% nm

````
Happy typing!
